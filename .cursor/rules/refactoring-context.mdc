# Refactoring Context: MediatR to Service/Repository

The project is currently undergoing a major refactoring on the `refactor/service-repository-pattern` branch.

**Goal**: Replace the CQRS pattern (using MediatR) with a simpler **Service and Repository pattern**.

**Current State**:

- MediatR has been removed, but the solution is **not currently compilable**.
- There are known issues with:
  - DTOs not matching service layer expectations.
  - Missing methods in repository interfaces.
  - Missing methods and properties in domain entities.

**New Architecture**:
The intended flow is `Controller` -> `Service` -> `Repository` -> `Database`.

Refer to [REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md](mdc:REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md) for full details on completed tasks and remaining work.
